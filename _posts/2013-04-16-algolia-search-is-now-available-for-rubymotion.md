[![Rubymotion search gem by Algolia is now

an iPhone, chances are you already now about the cool project that is
[RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/)! I quote:

> "It lets you quickly develop and test native iOS applications for iPhone or
iPad, all using the awesome Ruby language you know and love."

And it rocks! It's actually used by the Ruby on Rails sponsor 37signals.

What if you could use your favorite search engine along with your favorite
language to create iOS apps? That's exactly what we propose with Algolia's
RubyMotion search gem that seamlessly integrates in your Ruby project. You
know the trick:

    
     
    gem 'motion-algolia-search'
    

The gem code is open source. You can fork it from
[github](https://github.com/algolia/motion-algolia-search).

Special thanks to the RubyMotion team and especially to
[Joffrey](https://twitter.com/joffreyjaffeux) for this integration!
